# User Service (gRPC)

This project is a **gRPC-based User Service** that I built to demonstrate my skills in **backend development**, **DevOps practices**, and **modern software architecture**. It provides functionality for user registration, login, verification, and fetching user details. The service is designed to be **scalable**, **efficient**, and **easy to deploy**.

## What I Did

1. **Designed and Implemented a gRPC Service**:
   - Created a user service with methods for registration, login, verification, and fetching user details.
   - Used **Protocol Buffers (protobuf)** to define the service interface and message formats.

2. **Containerized the Application**:
   - Built a **Docker image** for the service to ensure it can run consistently across different environments.
   - Set up a **Docker Compose** configuration to manage multi-container deployments (e.g., combining the service with a database).

3. **Implemented DevOps Practices**:
   - Automated the build, test, and deployment process using **Jenkins**.
   - Ensured the service is scalable and easy to deploy in production environments.

4. **Extended Functionality**:
   - Added token-based authentication and verification to secure the service.
   - Integrated with a database (if applicable) to store and retrieve user data.

## Purpose and Aim

The aim of this project is to demonstrate my ability to:
- Build **scalable and efficient backend systems** using modern technologies like gRPC and Protocol Buffers.
- Use **DevOps tools and practices** (Docker, Docker Compose, Jenkins) to automate and streamline deployment.
- Design and implement **secure and reliable APIs** for real-world applications.

This project is a practical example of how I approach software development, from design and implementation to deployment and automation.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, gRPC, Protocol Buffers
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose, Jenkins
- **Database**: (Optional) PostgreSQL or any other database for persistent storage
- **Tools**: npm, Git, BloomRPC (for testing gRPC APIs)

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)
- Jenkins (optional, for CI/CD)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/user-service.git
   cd user-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the gRPC server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. (Optional) Run with Docker:
   ```bash
   docker build -t user-service .
   docker run -p 50051:50051 user-service
   ```

5. (Optional) Use Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## DevOps Integration

### Docker
I containerized the service using Docker to ensure it can run consistently across different environments. The `Dockerfile` defines the environment and dependencies required to run the service.

### Docker Compose
I set up a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage multi-container deployments. For example, the service can be combined with a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage.

### Jenkins
I automated the build, test, and deployment process using Jenkins. The `Jenkinsfile` defines the pipeline stages, including:
- Building the application
- Running tests
- Building the Docker image
- Deploying the service

## Key Features

1. **User Registration**:
   - Allows new users to register with their name, email, and password.

2. **User Login**:
   - Authenticates users and returns a token for subsequent requests.

3. **Token Verification**:
   - Verifies the validity of a user's token.

4. **Fetch User Details**:
   - Retrieves user details based on their ID.

5. **Scalable and Efficient**:
   - Uses gRPC for high-performance communication.
   - Containerized for easy deployment and scaling.

## How This Demonstrates My Skills

### Backend Development
- I designed and implemented a **gRPC-based service** using Node.js and Protocol Buffers.
- I created **secure and efficient APIs** for user management.

### DevOps
- I **containerized the application** using Docker and set up a multi-container environment with Docker Compose.
- I automated the CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, demonstrating my ability to streamline deployments.

### Problem-Solving
- I implemented **token-based authentication** to secure the service.
- I ensured the service is **scalable and performant** by using gRPC and containerization.

### Full-Stack Development
- I handled the **entire development lifecycle**, from designing the service to deploying it in a production-like environment.

## Conclusion

This project showcases my ability to build **modern, scalable, and efficient backend systems** and deploy them using **DevOps best practices**. It is a practical example of how I approach software development, and I hope it provides a clear understanding of my skills and expertise.
